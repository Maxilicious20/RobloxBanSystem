#RobloxBanSystem

A powerful and easy-to-integrate Roblox ban system that uses a large, community-driven database of user IDs.
This database contains players who were found in inappropriate or "Corn" games or groups, allowing developers to automatically detect and block them from joining their own experiences.

The system is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and privacy awareness. Developers can easily add it to their games to help maintain a safer and cleaner player environment.

Features:

🔒 Centralized database with thousands of flagged user IDs

⚙️ Simple integration into any Roblox experience

🚫 Automatic banning or kicking of detected players

💾 Optional local caching for faster lookups

🧩 Open for contribution — help expand and improve the list
